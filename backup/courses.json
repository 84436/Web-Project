You are living in a dream world, which is full of catch-phrases like \"future capabilities\" and \"if you can imagine it, you can do it\". That's good news, people like you are necessary in order for society to chart new paths forward. \n\nHowever, once you've set your train off, you soon realize that the real world is not all \"roses and sunshine\". Real problems start raising their ugly heads and demand your attention or your resources. This is such an awkward time: you don't like to become involved in this day-to-day nitty gritty, you only like the \"vision thing\", you were probably expecting things to run \"according to the manual\", you feel frustrated or helpless. Very soon, you find yourself locked into a corner, with the \"Mike Tyson\" of a problem hitting you hard and fast from all possible angles. \n\nDON'T GIVE UP! People have been in that situation before. I have personally been there many times before, over the course of my rocky 27 years in Marketing and Entrepreneurship. And I managed to nail  down the 6 \"death factors\" which, if left unattended, will bury your business to the ground. And I'm offering all that vital knowledge to you, for FREE! You need to:\n\ngrasp those factors\nappreciate how they work\nkeep them always in mind, and \nhave a plan of action for each one of them\nBEFORE they become a menace for your business.\n\nHere's to your success!"

Most instructors write up content and use a teleprompter to deliver it, I don't. All my lessons are taught with only notes for my review. I believe the best instructors SHOULD be able to talk about their topics without a script. Because I do not follow a vetted script my lessons take you on a journey. I talk about the real-world success and more importantly the mistakes I made in my companies. I teach each topic off the top of my head because I know the content inside and out. After building 20 companies and hundreds of products I know all the mistakes you can make and will teach you how to avoid them. All my courses also use real-world examples that I ACTUALLY did vs pointing to someones else's success and teaching to it.\n\nAdditionally all my courses feature numerous downloads of the ACTUAL files I use to build my companies. I walk you through each one and demonstrate how I use them to rapidly grow my ideas into companies.\n\nAnd finally I ACTUALLY am the one in the forum answering questions, not some intern or outsourced partner. My responses are sometimes pithy, sometimes funny, sometimes insightful, and always genuine.\n\nMoney Back Guarantee\n\nAll my courses come with an unconditional, Udemy backed, 30 day money-back guarantee."
